# e-shop-exercise
Graded home exercise for the Information Technology HTML/CSS course at OAMK, 2nd period, 2022.

The task was to produce an implementation of a UI design using only html and CSS.

Our E-shop is selling chips, nuts, and related stuff in some Nordic countries. The design and implementation include three webpages/views: product listing view, detailed view of one product chosen from the product listing, and the shopping cart view.
Links between the three pages are functional; other functionality is not required.
